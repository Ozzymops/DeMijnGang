## ChatGPT's suggestions:
Dark Theme with Vintage Textures
    Color Scheme: Deep charcoal, rusty browns, and muted golds with off-white text to mimic the soot-covered environment of a coal mine.
    Backgrounds: Use subtle textures like worn leather, old paper, or weathered wood to evoke the feel of old mineworker tools or classrooms.
    Typography: Choose serif fonts that mimic old printing presses or handwriting styles, paired with a modern sans-serif for readability.
    Images: Sepia-toned or black-and-white photos of mining equipment, historical documents, or the mineworker school itself.
    Interactive Elements: Use a lantern or carbide lamp as a loading icon or hover effect on buttons.
Retro Newspaper Style
    Color Scheme: Creamy whites, faded blacks, and subtle reds to mimic old newspapers.
    Layout: Structured like a vintage newspaper, with headlines, subheadings, and columns for different sections of the site.
    Typography: Old-style newspaper fonts, with large, bold headlines and smaller body text.
    Imagery: Vintage photos, scanned documents, and advertisements related to mining history.
    Interactive Elements: A newspaper “flip” effect when switching between pages, or “highlight” animations that mimic reading a newspaper with a marker.
