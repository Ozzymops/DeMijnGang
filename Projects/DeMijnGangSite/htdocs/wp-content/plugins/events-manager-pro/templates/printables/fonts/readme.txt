This is a temlate folder for custom fonts, which you should copy (this entire fonts folder, not just contents) over to either:

/wp-content/plugin-templates/events-manager-pro/printables
/wp-content/themes/yourtheme/plugins/events-manager-pro/printables
/wp-content/themes/parenttheme/plugins/events-manager-pro/printables

Note that in all cases, you should end up with a 'fonts' folder in the 'printables' folder.

After this, you can copy over ttf and otf files into this folder, and then click the 'Regenerate Fonts List' link under Settings > Bookings > Printables > Default Font
