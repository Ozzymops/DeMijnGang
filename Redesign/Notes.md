Do not be scared that everything will look different in new theme. Your content: pages, posts, media, comments, categories etc etc are all there, nothing is lost. You will need to create new menu, probably.

Theme is only presentation of content. Adjust it in composer. (layout, colors, tipography etc)

Block editors are 'extenders' of theme. Use them to adjust elements (header, footer, page, post)

Plugins are extra functionality on the top of WP CMS. Switch off all you think are not essential for your site.

Do not be affraid to experiment, we all leearn from mistakes. And read documentation, WordPress and theme of choice. If you have questions, ask on their support forums; Google and Youtube are not always friends. Draw your new site on paper and work from there. Six to eight weeks and you'll be OK.
